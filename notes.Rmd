## What is this?
This is an R notebook to help visualize the numbers regarding COVID-19 in Lubbock, TX. I've been keeping this data in JSON format as press releases come out from the [City of Lubbock](https://twitter.com/cityoflubbock). The code for this notebook can be found here -> [https://github.com/jreina/lubbock-covid](https://github.com/jreina/lubbock-covid).

Last Updated: `r Sys.time()`

## Chart

```{r, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library('jsonlite')

cases <- as.data.frame(fromJSON("./data/cases.json"))
dates <-as.Date(paste(cases$date, cases$time), "%m/%d/%Y %H:%M")

plot(range(dates), 
     range(cases$confirmed),
     type = 'n', 
     xlab = 'Date', 
     ylab = 'Count')

lines(dates, cases$confirmed, col = "black", lwd = 2.5)
lines(dates, cases$recovered, col = "green", lwd = 2.5)
lines(dates, cases$deaths, col = "red", lwd = 2.5)
legend(x = 'topleft', legend = c('Confirmed', 'Recovered', 'Deaths'), 
       col = c('black', 'green', 'red'), lty = 1, lwd = 2.5)
```

## Data

```{r, results='asis', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(xtable)
print(xtable(cases), type = "html")
```
